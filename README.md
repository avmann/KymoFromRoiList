# KymosFromRoiList
This is a macro to generate Kymographs from multiple rois for a timeseries designed for Fiji/ImageJ.

This macro requires the KymoResliceWide plugin for ImageJ/Fiji to run.

KymosFromRoiList applies the KymoResliceWide plugin to all elements in the roi list.
It will automatically save the generated kymopgraphs as tif files.
There are options included to: 
(1) save the regions/lines of interest
(2) stretch kymographs in x-y dimension to facilitate analysis later on
